# Changes in Crime Rates During the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial changes in the daily activities of millions of Americans, with many businesses and schools closed, public events cancelled and states introducing stay-at-home orders.

In this study we are trying to answer questions about how covid lockdowns and certain limitations altered the crime rates in Chicago between 2019 and 2022. 

We treat 2020 as having the most dramatic impact on the population due to the lockdown that started on March 21, 2020 and many restrictions continue until the mid 2021. 

The crime rate with the largest increase in 2020 was homicide. According to the study homicide rate in Chicago increased by almost 57% when with previous year.
