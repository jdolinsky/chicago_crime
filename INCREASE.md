# Changes in Crime Rates During the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial changes in the daily activities of millions of Americans, with many businesses and schools closed, public events cancelled and states introducing stay-at-home orders.

In this study we are trying to answer questions about how covid lockdowns and certain limitations altered the crime rates in Chicago between 2019 and 2022. 

We treat 2020 as having the most dramatic impact on the population due to the lockdown that started on March 21, 2020 and many restrictions continue until the mid 2021. 

The crime rate with the largest increase in 2020 was homicide. According to the study homicide rate in Chicago increased by almost 57% when compared with the previous year. This includes first/second degree murder, reckless homicide, and involuntary manslaughter. The homicide rates started a sharp decline in 2022 which continued in 2023. 

The second category with the highest increase in 2020 was Arson. In particular, arson by fire was the highest type of arson in 2020 - 472 cases. In 2019, the total arson by fire was 260 cases. Some studies attributed it to George Floyd protests which took place in May of 2020. During these protests a lot of police cars and other properties were set on fire. Some other factors included over-occupied properties due to lockdowns, abandoned commercial properties. The most affected areas were west and south of the Loop. The hightest arson rate in 2020 was in Austin community area. 

The third category that saw the highest increase in 2020 was weapons violation which includes:  unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition, unlawful use or sale of firearms and ammunition.
